# Simple Image Gallery

## Project Title
**Simple Image Gallery**: A web application designed to showcase the portfolio of a design agency, featuring a responsive image gallery and interactive sections.

## Project Description
The **Simple Image Gallery** is an interactive web application that displays a collection of images for a design agency called "Creative Minds." This project demonstrates how to create a visually appealing gallery with smooth navigation and user engagement through a contact form. 

### Key Features:
- A responsive image gallery that allows users to click on images for a larger view in a modal.
- Smooth scrolling navigation for a seamless user experience.
- A contact form with basic validation to ensure user inputs are correctly filled out.

### Technologies Used:
- **HTML5**: For structure and content of the web application.
- **CSS3**: For styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity, including modal functionality and smooth scrolling.

### Challenges Faced:
During the development of this project, I faced challenges in implementing the modal functionality and ensuring smooth scrolling worked seamlessly across different browsers. Future improvements may include:
- Enhancing the modal to display additional information about each image.
- Adding user authentication for the contact form.

## How to Install and Run the Project
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash

## How to Use the Project
Once the project is running in your browser:

Click on any image in the gallery to view it in a modal format.
Use the navigation links at the top to smoothly scroll to different sections of the page, including "About Us," "Our Work," and "Contact Us."
Fill out the contact form with your name, email, and message. Ensure all fields are filled correctly before submitting.
